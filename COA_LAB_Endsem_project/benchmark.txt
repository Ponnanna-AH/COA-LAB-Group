Results (for Hotspot benchmark)


LRR

IPS = 749910 instructions per seconds
CPS = 348 cycles per second

=> IPC = IPS/CPS = 2154


GTO

IPS = 708577 instructions per second
CPS = 291 cycles per second

=> IPC = IPS/CPS = 2433


KAWS

IPS = 692225 instructions per seconds
CPS = 284 cycles per seconds

=> IPC = IPS/CPS = 2439


Taking LRR as baseline, performance values for different schedulers

Our Results -

LRR = 100%
GTO = 113.05%
KAWS = 113.34%

Author results ( from Research Paper )

LRR = 100%
GTO = 117.03%
